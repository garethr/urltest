A wrapper around WebTest which provides a nice domain specific language for
testing URLs in WSGI applications. The following example demonstrates usage:

<pre>#!/usr/bin/env python

from example_app import application
from urltest import verify_urls
                
if __name__ == "__main__":
    urls = (
        {'url':"/", 'code':200},
        {'url':"/bob", 'code':200},
        {'url':"/jim", 'code':404},
        {'url':"/jim", 'method': "POST", 'code':405},
    )    
    verify_urls(urls, application)</pre>
